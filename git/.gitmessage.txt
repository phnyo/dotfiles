// 
//    Simplify serialize.h's exception handling
// 
//    Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
//    implementations, as well as related methods.
// 
//    As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
//    called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
//    exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
//    with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
//    code).
// 
//    As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
//    only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
//    by !eof().
// 
//    fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
//    them.
